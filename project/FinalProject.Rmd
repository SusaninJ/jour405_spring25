```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```
```{r}
tempo <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SusaninJ/jour405_spring25/refs/heads/main/NCAA%20Tournament-KenPom%20-%20Sheet1.csv") |> clean_names()
```
```{r}
tempo |> 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(tempo_rating),
    sd = sd(tempo_rating)
  )
```
This was done to get a baseline of what we're working with. The main takeaway I had from these numbers is that four of the five national champions had a tempo above the mean.

```{r}
tempo |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=tempo_rating, y = games_won))
```

I also wanted to visualize it through this scatterplot.
